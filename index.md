<!--## About Me-->

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg"> -->

I am an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Medical College of Wisconsin, in the Department of Neurology, working with [Dr. Jeffrey Binder](http://www.neuro.mcw.edu/index.php/people/jeffrey-binder-md/). Before joining [the Language Imaging Laboratory at MCW](https://www.neuro.mcw.edu/), I completed my PhD studies at New York University, supervised by [Prof. Liina Pylkk√§nen](https://wp.nyu.edu/neurolinglab/people/liina-pylkkanen/). I received Ph.D in Linguistics from NYU in 2019.

Outside work, I play the violin (and a bit of keyboard) and do some arrangements/composition as well. I am a part-time student at Juilliard Extension.
